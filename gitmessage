# 50-character subject line in imperative mood
#
# All paragraphs should wrap at 72-characters and be
# separared with a single blank line. Optimally there should
# be a paragraph for each of these bullet points at least:
#
# - Explain what this commit solves / fixes / addresses
#
# - Summarize what changed and what side effects this has
#
# If you need to explain or summarize a bunch of things then
# consider splitting the commit into smaller commits or use
# bullet points, like seen above.
#
# Include a link to the Trello card here if necessary and add a
# notice if this fixed an issue on Github like so:
#
# Fix: #123
